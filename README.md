# Challenge 13: Mapping Earthquakes

## Overview of Mapping Earquakes
The purpose of this project is to create a map with three base layers and three overlays. The three base layers - only one can be visible on the map at a time - are:
- Streets
- Statellite streets
- Dark

The three overlays:
- All earthquake data in the past 7 days 
- Tectonic plates data 
- Earthquakes with a magnitude greater than 4.5 in the past 7 days 

The structure of the webpage is in [index.html](https://github.com/Hala-INTJ/Mapping_Earthquakes/blob/main/Earthquake_Challenge/index.html), the code is in [challenge_logic.js](https://github.com/Hala-INTJ/Mapping_Earthquakes/blob/main/Earthquake_Challenge/static/js/challenge_logic.js), and the [style.css](https://github.com/Hala-INTJ/Mapping_Earthquakes/tree/main/Earthquake_Challenge/static/css) is used to customize and style the map and the legend.
